This is a blog to document my personal work in code. I’m mostly doing it to get myself into motion with some projects, so I’ll (boringly) be documenting what I’m doing, and (maybe more interesting) highlighting what I’m running into.

To start out the blog, earlier today I signed up to be a member at the Hacker Dojo. I went there for the first time yesterday to find out what it was like and see if the space was a good fit. I’m one of those people where if I’m sitting at my desk at home I’m likely to screw around and do other things instead of getting more work done, so I feel having a place to go to and “work” (that isn’t the office) will make me a little more efficient. I’m also hoping to meet up with other people there, among other things, and expand myself.
