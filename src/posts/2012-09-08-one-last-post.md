Okay, one last post. Just wanted to show a diagram of the storyboard for the iOS version. The Storyboard feature is really neat. I hated doing UI work before they added this, it just seemed convoluted. I’m sure it’ll get worse when I actually get into talking to the UI from the code. Designing the workflow is a lot nicer now, though, at least, and I can see that it works even without data by running it in the Simulator.
