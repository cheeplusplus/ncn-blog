*From a Tumblr ask,*

**Anonymous asked: yes i was wondering how to make a bot like your groompbot but make it post things from a different channel and reddit**

Groompbot is open source, so you can already use it and configure it for a different YouTube channel and subreddit.

If you go to https://github.com/cheeplusplus/groompbot you can check out the project, and see what you need to get going. Itâ€™s as simple as installing gdata and praw for Python, setting up the configuration file, and running the script at a regular interval.
