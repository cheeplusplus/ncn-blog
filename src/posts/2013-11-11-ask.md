*From a Tumblr ask,*

**Anonymous asked: Hello, I start developing an android application and I arrive to check the if the airplane mode is changed and this work fine . but now what I want to know is the event on checking the checkbox of airplane mode . I get the event of airplane mode change but I want to do something when user click on airplane mode and before connection change to airplane in other way I want the event on keypress of airplane mode checkbox. I 'm waiting with please for your response.**

Sorry, this isn’t possible! I assume you’re already listening to the broadcast event for the airplane mode change, but that’s the only thing an application is allowed to do when someone is switching into airplane mode from the settings menu.
