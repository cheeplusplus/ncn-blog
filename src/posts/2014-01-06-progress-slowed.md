I’ve been busy with a lot of annoyances like real life, but I’ve completed a rewrite of the database generation script for MyConbook, which introduces multi-convention support in preperation for the iOS app, as well as a redesign of the Android app I’ve been working on in my spare time. I’ve also been working on the side with an art site (which will remain unnamed) as a part-time developer, which has been eating at some of my extra outside-work development time.

I have a couple blog posts I really want to get to, including some about project planning and organization (similar to my Trello post, this time about OneNote). I’ll have to get to writing those soon, but I’m not dead.
