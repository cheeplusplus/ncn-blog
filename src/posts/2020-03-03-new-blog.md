It's 2020! And Tumblr might as well be dead, which means it's time to move everything to a shiny new home.

For the new blog, I ported everything over to my own static site generator called [sssg](https://github.com/cheeplusplus/simplestaticsitegen). It lets you create a static website with plain HTML, Markdown, or Jinja templates, and you can easily have customizable template pages, like this blog does!

I made the theme to this myself, along with some photos of my own computer and text for flair.

To make figuring out how to use SSSG easier, [this blog](https://github.com/cheeplusplus/ncn-blog) is also public under my Github! It shows how to use it with plain Markdown files, a dynamically generated HTML (the index page), and a custom page template. Also how to deploy straight to S3 from a Github push using only Github Actions. Enjoy!

Actually posting here is still limited, but with the new format I'm hoping to get to it more often.
